== Explanation of User Creation ==

The creation of a user within the context of the SEO Metrics plugin is aimed at enhancing user experience and security within the SEO Reporting Automation Software ecosystem. This feature was implemented in response to identified demand for passwordless login functionality.

When a user initiates a connection with the SEO Metrics plugin through the WordPress dashboard, they are presented with a consent form. Upon agreement, a user account is created for them with the username 'seo-metrics' and the email 'helper@seometrics.net'. The password is randomly generated using WordPress's default `wp_generate_password()` function.

The primary purpose of creating an administrative user is to streamline the login process for SEO Metrics users by eliminating the need for passwords. Additionally, it facilitates the provision of temporary, passwordless access to selected users or developers via the SEO Metrics Dashboard. This functionality empowers website owners to exercise precise control over access permissions, determining who can access the system and for how long. Ultimately, the objective is to enable SEO executives to efficiently perform website-related tasks within a specified timeframe, all while maintaining stringent security measures.
